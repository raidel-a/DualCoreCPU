Singlecycle seems for this prject versus Pipelined GPU due to simplicity compared

### Singlecycle
- Easier to implement due to simpler control logic
- More straightforward dev process
- Doesn't need complex sync between stages
- Consistent timing for all instructions

### Limits
- Must operate at speed of slowest instruction
- Less efficient for complex instructions
- Lower overall throughput compared to pipelined design
